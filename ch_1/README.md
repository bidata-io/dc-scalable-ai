# Chapter 1: Introduction to Scalable AI Systems with PyTorch
- **Lesson 1.1: Overview of Scalability in AI Systems**
  - Learning Objective: Understand the concept of scalability and its importance in AI systems.
  - Functions: element-wise mathematical `tensor` operations (`.add`, `.sub`, `.mul`, `.div`, `.pow`, `.dot`)

- **Lesson 1.2: Introduction to PyTorch**
  - Learning Objective: Understand the basics of PyTorch and its role in scalable AI.
  - Functions: `torch.tensor`, basic tensor operations
    
- **Lesson 1.3: Coding with and Without PyTorch**
  - Learning Objective: Compare and contrast traditional Python code with PyTorch code, implementing similar operations using PyTorch for efficiency and scalability.
  - Functions: `torch` operations, matrix multiplications, and element-wise operations
