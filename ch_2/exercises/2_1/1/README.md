# Setting Up PyTorch Lightning

## Context
In this exercise, you’ll start by setting up a basic PyTorch Lightning environment. PyTorch Lightning simplifies your code by handling the training loop and optimizing scalability. This exercise will walk you through initializing a simple LightningModule, defining a forward pass, and preparing your data. By the end, you’ll have a working model structure that you can build on in later steps.
