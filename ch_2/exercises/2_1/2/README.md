# Implementing the Training Step

## Context

Now that you have set up the `LightningModule`, it’s time to implement the training logic. In this exercise, you’ll define the `training_step` method, which is responsible for a single step of training. This method will compute the model’s output and calculate the loss.

## Pre-Exercise Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
import scikit-learn
import numpy as np
import seaborn
import bokeh
import scipy
import tensorflow
import pytorch-lightning
import torch
import torchvision
```
